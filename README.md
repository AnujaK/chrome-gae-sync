chrome-gae-sync
==========

##### What?

A ready to use and tested backend for your Chrome applications is chrome-gae-sync. As the name implies, it will connect your application to Google App Engine. 


##### Why?

We happen to spend so much time in coding and testing CRUD operations. Will it not be great if we get something to plug in and be able to access the Chrome app from where we had left it last time? 

You can be more productive in building the functionality of the app by using this project in your app.

##### How?

Just do some simple configurations and plug this project into yours. Using OAuth 2.0, your Chrome app will connect to Google App Engine and access its data.
